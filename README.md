Hello! I'm experimenting with storing Unity projects on GitHub, to make them easier to access from my laptop, mainly.
And, for a reason I like a little less, when applying to jobs, people wanna see my GitHub page. I've done a lot of projects,
but if I don't store them on my GitHub page, they're worth nothing, I guess.

Anyway, this project is meant to be a "playground" of sorts. A basic space for me to throw things into and see what happens before
I put them on the big screen. We'll see how useful it actually ends up being, since things will probably act differently in their game
environments. It's also just a space for me to mess around with when I wanna make something fun but I don't have any specific ideas.
